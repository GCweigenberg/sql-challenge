# sql-challenge
This activity involves researching employees at a company during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data using various queries, joins, and calculations. Lastly, I created an Entity-Relationship-Diagram to visualize the Datebase.
